# NeuralBlend-Submissions

This repo contains all the assignments from the semester project NeuralBlend offered the Brain & Cognitive Society IIT Kanpur.

In this project we wish to make a style transfer model by training datasets from scratch which will detect some pre-trained objects and apply style transfer to it.
